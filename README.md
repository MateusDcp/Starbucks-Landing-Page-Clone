# â˜• Starbucks Landing Page Clone  

### A modern and responsive copy of the Starbucks official website  

This project is a **practice landing page** inspired by the Starbucks official website.  
It was built to improve my skills in **HTML, CSS, and responsive design**, focusing on layout reproduction, visual consistency, and clean code.  

ðŸ”¹ Features:  
- Fully responsive design  
- Hero section with background image   
- Visual fidelity to the original Starbucks design  

ðŸ“Œ Next steps:  
In the future, I plan to enhance this project by adding **JavaScript interactivity** and possibly integrating a **backend** for handling products and orders.
